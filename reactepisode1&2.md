Perfect! Based on your bullet points, here’s a **clean, structured summary** of what you’ve studied so far:

---

# **📚 Project Setup & React Study Summary**

### **1. GitHub Setup**

* Created a **GitHub repository** for the project.
* Uploaded the project to GitHub.
* Learned to **connect local repo to GitHub** and push code.

---

### **2. NPM Initialization**

* Ran `npm init` to initialize the project.
* Learned about the **package.json** file:

  * Stores project metadata.
  * Tracks dependencies and scripts.

---

### **3. Installed Parcel Bundler**

* Installed Parcel using:

```
npm install -D parcel
```

* Result:

  * `node_modules/` folder created → stores installed packages.

* Studied **bundlers** and their purpose:

  * Combine multiple files into one.
  * Optimize code for browsers.

---

### **4. Understanding Key Files**

* **package.json** → project metadata, dependencies, scripts
* **package-lock.json** → exact dependency versions for consistency
* **node_modules** → installed packages for the project

---

### **5. Installed React**

* Installed **React** and **ReactDOM** using NPM.
* Learned **how to import React and ReactDOM** in your project.
* Ready to start building React components.

---

✅ **Next Steps Suggestion**

* Learn how to **create your first React component**.
* Learn **JSX syntax** and rendering components with `ReactDOM.render`.
* Practice **push updates to GitHub** episode-wise after each new feature.
